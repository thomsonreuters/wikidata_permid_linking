# WikiData → PermID Linking

## What is this? 

The Thomson Reuters [PermID](http://permid.org) is a unique open data identifierfor entities that Thomson Reuters tracks such as Organizations, Financial Instruments, Countries and Currencies.

WikiData [supports](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P3347) the PermID natively as a property. 

This project contains the scripts and hand mappings for these entities. By working on this in the open we aim to encourage trust in our mapping methodology and community participation.
